This is made possible by our people: agile minds, ability to see beyond the obvious, and act effectively in an ever-changing global business landscape.\u00a0 As you\u2019ll discover, our culture supports this. Diverse, international and shaped by a variety of different perspectives, we\u2019re driven by a shared sense of purpose. At every level agile minds are rewarded with competitive pay, support and the opportunity to excel.\n\nBackground\n\nLiving Wills is the global regulatory response to protect the global economy and financial system from the potential default of global, systemically important financial institutions such as Deutsche Bank (DB).\u00a0 As a result, DB considers Living Wills to be one of the most topical and strategically important regulatory requirements. Living Wills focuses on establishing both recovery and resolution plans for DB as well as ensuring that DB has the appropriate processes in place so that a crisis at DB would not impact the greater financial system. The resolution plan aims to ensure the orderly resolution of DB, if its recovery plan fails, and keep its critical businesses going.\n\nTo support the Living Wills recovery and resolution plans,\nOrganisational Development Unit\n(ODU) will be leading the creation of a Service Catalogue for services consumed by the various US Businesses. This will require understanding the Fed expectations of this deliverable and then executing on that to satisfy the Fed requirements. Creating the Service Catalogue inter alia requires developing a service taxonomy, mapping resources and costs to services and legal entities to ultimately estimate costs per service. This requires working with all the Infrastructure COOs in the US to agree the service taxonomy and help with mapping the current teams and costs to the services. Finally depending on the solution (dependency with Jade), implementation in terms of either restructuring UBR or moving employees into separate legal entities might be required.\n\nIn order to deliver DB\u2019s U.S. key project initiatives, a dedicated role is now required to lead the project on a daily basis, supported by external consultants and in close cooperation with the US Living Wills team, Infrastructure COOs in the US and the ODU Process team. The ideal candidate possesses proven project management skills on complex projects. This is an opportunity to gain exposure across DB\u2019s businesses, products and operations.\n\nKey Responsibilities:\n\n\nOverall project management\n\nManage risks, issues and project status for project\n\nDevelop and produce senior management presentations\n\nDisseminate information and guidance on regulatory developments that could impact the project initiatives.\n\nOversee project management reporting (e.g. status, risks, missed milestones and issues, budget)\n\nCoordinate updates to senior committees, regulators, and senior management as necessary.\n\n\nRequirements:\n\n\nAble to lead a team of internal and external employees and check activities against promises/commitments\n\nA strong project manager with a minimum of 6-8 years experience managing complex projects\n\nProven track record for managing risks, issues and project plans\n\nA strong ability to develop effective relationships and engage senior stakeholders\n\nAbility to understand cross program risks and issues and provide leverage to assist stakeholders in resolving them\n\nAn appetite to work in areas outside previous expertise or comfort zone and an ability to quickly adapt to new regulatory guidance and requirements\n\nAbility to engage and coordinate senior stakeholders towards an agreed objective and timeline\n\nMicrosoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint skills\n\nRigorous and meticulous in the production of senior management and regulatory deliverables\n\nProficient in English, both spoken and written.\n\nDriven to succeed with a focus on driving progress against timelines\n\nCapability to work in a dynamic environment\n\nDB experience desirable\n\nGood team player, knows how to build his/her own network\n\n\nPreferred:\n\n\nProject management qualification\n\nConsultancy experience\n\n\n\n\n\n",
